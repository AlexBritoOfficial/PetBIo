# PetBIo
PetBio is the first app that you build in "The Complete Android & Java Developer Course â€“ Build 21 Apps" Udemy Course. 
It is a really simple app. The application navigates between two activities displaying the bio of a selected pet.

Concepts Involved:
Intents to launch new activities.
Bundles to extract the data being passed between activities. 

Learning Experience:
I have taken a Android Mobile Development class prior to this course. But it wasnt until after watching the videos, that the "putExtra()" method finally registered with me. It works as a "Map" D.S. Where you give a key and value to the function, helping the called activity know what data is what. 

onActivityResult(). How this method handles the data that is being passed from the new activity back to its original caller. 

Utilizing the power of the "switch" case statement to reference a widget by its Resource ID value.
